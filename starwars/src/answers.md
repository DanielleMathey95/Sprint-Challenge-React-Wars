1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a framework that allows you to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript all in one place. React responds to data changes instantly, the DOM doesn't have to reload and it makes the user experience much smoother. 

2. Describe component state.

Component state is where the components data is stored and is linked to a single component and cannot be seen outside of this component. 

3. Describe props.

Props are sort of like arguments in a function. Props are passed from the parent component which invoke the component and the props in a component cannot be changed. 

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

A side effect is anything that affects something outside of the scope of the function being executed. We sync effects in React components with state and prop changes.
